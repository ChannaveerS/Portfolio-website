Using V0.dev to build my portfolio website was an interesting experience, as it introduced me to AI-assisted development with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and ShadCN components. The tool made it easy to generate a structured, responsive layout quickly, but I learned that precise prompting is essential to getting the desired results. Iterating through multiple refinements helped me understand how to break down a UI into reusable React components like <HeroSection /> and <ProjectCard />, improving both efficiency and maintainability. While V0 accelerated the initial setup, manual adjustments were still needed for styling and responsiveness. Overall, this experience showed me how AI can streamline development while still requiring a developerâ€™s touch to fine-tune the final product.
